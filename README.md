ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Panos.

- I am a Business Computing and IT graduate and I am trying to further develop my IT skills.

- Currently searching for a masters in Computer Science.

- My current knowledge is intermediate in C++ and beginner in Python.

- My current focus is on :
      => Web development (Currently doing a full-semester course on in-depth Web Dev with Vue.js,Bootstrap,React, HTML/CSS/JS, at the The University of Athens) 
                              and 
      => JAVA (vcurrenlt doing a full-semester course on in-depth Java development, at the The University of Athens).
      
- I aspire to be a fullstack software developer, or generally find a software related job.

- I am gradually adding the work I've made here, while I'm getting familiar with the environment.
